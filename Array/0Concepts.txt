1. Whenever the value range is in [0, n-1], the O(1) space can be obtained by modifying the array by negating.

2. Whenever the problem involves some SUM concept, it's generally O(n^2) or O(n^3) problem with sorting the data 
    and looping over the data to find the combinations.
	problems : #40, #16, #17

3. Backtracking is mostly used tho find combinations when only different combinstions are to be tested and 
    no sum property is involved.
